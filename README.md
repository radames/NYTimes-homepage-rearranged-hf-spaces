# The New York Times Sentiment Analysis

This project is an experiment running sentiment analysis on the currentÂ [New York Times](https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml)Â homepage headlines RSS. It also provides a sorting button to toggle betweenÂ good and bad newsÂ firstðŸ˜› . It's built with aÂ [custom SvelveKit front-end](https://huggingface.co/spaces/radames/NYTimes-homepage-rearranged/tree/main/client)Â , served by aÂ [Flask application](https://huggingface.co/spaces/radames/NYTimes-homepage-rearranged/blob/main/app.py)Â and usingÂ [transformers pipeline for the sentiment analysis.](https://huggingface.co/siebert/sentiment-roberta-large-english)

### Notes

#### Install Node with NVM

ThisÂ [Node script](https://huggingface.co/spaces/radames/NYTimes-homepage-rearranged/blob/main/install-node.sh)Â install node LTS and create symbolic links toÂ `/home/user/.local/bin/`Â as it seems like we don't have permission to updateÂ `$PATH`Â env

#### main.py

Because the Spaces run a python application, seeÂ [`app_file`](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces#:~:text=0.88.0%2C%200.89.0%2C%201.0.0.-,app_file,-%3A%20string%0APath%20to)Â on docs.Â main.pyÂ is just a simple python subprocess to runÂ `make build-all`Â SeeÂ [`Makefile`](https://huggingface.co/spaces/radames/NYTimes-homepage-rearranged/blob/main/Makefile)

#### SvelteKit Node Adapter?

SvelteKit eventually can be used as our primary web application withÂ [`@sveltejs/adapter-node`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-node)Â adaptor and Flask the API application with your ML project. However, there is an unsolved issue to enableÂ [dynamic basepath](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/595), which blocks the possibility to embedded deployment or using a relative path.
